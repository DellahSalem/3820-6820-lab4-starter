# Starter repo for first ansible automation lab

## Please make a folder called lab4 on your Ansible Management node (e.g., within your home directory), cd into the lab4 directory and clone this repo there.

After all files are cloned you'll edit two files:

1. Edit the my_inventory file to add the IP addresses of your target hosts

2. Edit roles/webapp/defaults/main.yml and add your repository address for the sample website you made in previous assignment as the value to the repository variable (that file has an example on how this will look like)
